# LUBM-UBA
[Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM) - Data Generator(UBA)](http://swat.cse.lehigh.edu/projects/lubm/)

A copy of the LUBM data generator. 

This tool generates syntetic OWL or DAML+OIL data over the Univ-Bench ontology in the unit of a university. These data are repeatable and customizable, by allowing user to specify seed for random number generation, the number of universities, and the starting index of the universities
